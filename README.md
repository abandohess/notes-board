# CS52 Lab 3: React Notes

Anders Bando-Hess - April 2018

What didn't work: I struggled a bit with Firebase. When I made code changes that would change the notes held in Firebase, I didn't realize the notes that already existed in Firebase didn't change. This now seems like an obvious observation.
I also wanted to use SemanticUI for styling, but failed to get it working.

What worked: the lab now works
